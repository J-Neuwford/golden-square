These challenges are to establish and drill fundamental skills in: 
 - TDD
 - OOP
 - debugging
 - pair programming

In this project I have learned to:
 - write tests for methods, classes and class systems using RSpec.
 - implement code by test driving.
 - design methods, classes and class systems from user specificatons.
 - use discovery debugging techniques to methodically work through bugs
 - develop my pair-programming skills, fulfulling driver and navigator roles 
 - use mocking to test classes in isolation

Phases: 
 - 1: Testing, 
 - 2: Challenges,
 - 3: Mocking,
 - 4: Solo Project: https://github.com/J-Neuwford/takeaway-project
