These challenges are to establish and drill fundamental skills in:

 - debugging
 - pair programming

In this project I have learned to:
 - write tests for methods, classes and class systems using RSpec.
 - implement code by test driving.
 - design methods, classes and class systems from user specificatons.
 - use discovery debugging techniques to methodically work through bugs
 - develop my pair-programming skills, fulfulling driver and navigator roles
